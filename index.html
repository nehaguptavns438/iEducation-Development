        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels:
        central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory
        education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to
        private schools in India is 7:5.</p></div>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th
            century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living
            there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built
            lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda
            was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
            taught in Ariano -PÃ¡li language</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the
            procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education;
            religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or
            celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The
            priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the
            warrior class, the Kshatriya, were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were
            taught their trade and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages </p>
